Patches are welcome!

Just keep in mind the following:

  * keep the same coding style
  * your code must fit in 80 columns wide with a TAB of 8
  * always check what a function returns if it is non-void. If you do not care
    about what is returned, explicitly declare it by casting it to void.
  * preferably use 'git format-patch' to generate your patch

You can send your patch via email to the author:

	Robin Hahling: <robin.hahling@gw-computing.net>

Or register to the official website:

	https://projects.gw-computing.net/projects/dfc

and add an issue with your patch attached.

Pull requests on the Github mirror are also welcomed.

Thanks for your contribution!
